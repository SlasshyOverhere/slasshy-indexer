# Google Drive OAuth 2.0 Credentials
# ============================================
#
# To enable Google Drive integration, you need to create OAuth 2.0 credentials
# in the Google Cloud Console. Follow these steps:
#
# 1. Go to Google Cloud Console: https://console.cloud.google.com/
#
# 2. Create a new project (or select an existing one):
#    - Click on the project dropdown at the top
#    - Click "New Project"
#    - Enter a name (e.g., "Slasshy Desktop")
#    - Click "Create"
#
# 3. Enable the Google Drive API:
#    - Go to "APIs & Services" > "Library"
#    - Search for "Google Drive API"
#    - Click on it and press "Enable"
#
# 4. Configure the OAuth consent screen:
#    - Go to "APIs & Services" > "OAuth consent screen"
#    - Select "External" user type (unless you have a Google Workspace)
#    - Click "Create"
#    - Fill in the required fields:
#      * App name: "Slasshy Desktop"
#      * User support email: your email
#      * Developer contact email: your email
#    - Click "Save and Continue"
#    - On Scopes page, click "Add or Remove Scopes"
#      * Add: https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly
#      * Add: https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email
#      * Add: https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.profile
#    - Click "Save and Continue"
#    - Add your email as a test user (required for testing)
#    - Click "Save and Continue"
#
# 5. Create OAuth 2.0 credentials:
#    - Go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
#    - Click "Create Credentials" > "OAuth client ID"
#    - Application type: "Desktop app"
#    - Name: "Slasshy Desktop Client"
#    - Click "Create"
#
# 6. Configure the redirect URI:
#    - After creating, click on your OAuth client
#    - Under "Authorized redirect URIs", add BOTH:
#      * https://indexer-oauth-callback.vercel.app/ (for production)
#      * http://localhost:8085/callback (for development)
#    - Click "Save"
#
# 7. Copy your credentials below:
#    - Client ID ends with ".apps.googleusercontent.com"
#    - Client Secret is a shorter alphanumeric string
#
# ============================================

# Your Google OAuth 2.0 Client ID
# Example: 123456789-abcdefghijklmnop.apps.googleusercontent.com
GDRIVE_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_CLIENT_ID.apps.googleusercontent.com

# Your Google OAuth 2.0 Client Secret
# Example: GOCSPX-abcdefghijklmnop123456
GDRIVE_CLIENT_SECRET=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET

# OAuth Redirect URI (optional - has sensible defaults)
# For production, this should point to your deployed callback page
# Default in production: https://indexer-oauth-callback.vercel.app/
# Default in development: http://localhost:8085/callback
# GDRIVE_REDIRECT_URI=https://indexer-oauth-callback.vercel.app/

# ============================================
# Notes
# ============================================
#
# - For PRODUCTION builds:
#   The redirect URI defaults to: https://indexer-oauth-callback.vercel.app/
#   Make sure this URL is added in Google Cloud Console under:
#   "APIs & Services" > "Credentials" > Your OAuth Client > "Authorized redirect URIs"
#
# - For DEVELOPMENT builds:
#   The redirect URI defaults to: http://localhost:8085/callback
#   A local server captures the callback automatically.
#
# - You can override the redirect URI by setting GDRIVE_REDIRECT_URI
#
# - For development, you can use "Testing" mode in the OAuth consent screen.
#   This limits access to test users you've added but doesn't require verification.
#
# - For production/distribution, you'll need to verify your app with Google.
#   This involves a review process that can take several days.
#
# - Keep your Client Secret private! Anyone with access to it can
#   impersonate your application.
